  Abstract                 = {Efforts to emulate the formidable information processing capabilities of the brain through neuromorphic engineering have been bolstered by recent progress in the fabrication of nonlinear, nanoscale circuit elements that exhibit synapse-like operational characteristics. However, conventional fabrication techniques are unable to efficiently generate structures with the highly complex interconnectivity found in biological neuronal networks. Here we demonstrate the physical realization of a self-assembled neuromorphic device which implements basic concepts of systems neuroscience through a hardware-based platform comprised of over a billion interconnected atomic-switch inorganic synapses embedded in a complex network of silver nanowires. Observations of network activation and passive harmonic generation demonstrate a collective response to input stimulus in agreement with recent theoretical predictions. Further, emergent behaviors unique to the complex network of atomic switches and akin to brain function are observed, namely spatially distributed memory, recurrent dynamics and the activation of feedforward subnetworks. These devices display the functional characteristics required for implementing unconventional, biologically and neurally inspired computational methodologies in a synthetic experimental system.},

  Abstract                 = {The sneak path problem is one of the major hindrances for the application of high density 3D crossbar resistive random access memory (RRAM). For the selector-less RRAM devices, nonlinear (NL) current-voltage (I-V) characteristics are an alternative approach to minimize the sneak paths. In this work we have demonstrated metallic IrOx nanocrystal (IrOx-NC) based selector-less crossbar RRAM devices in an IrOx/AlOx/IrOx-NC/AlOx/W structure with very reliable hysteresis resistive switching of >10 000 cycles, stable multiple levels, and high temperature (HT) data retention. Moreover, an improvement in the NL behavior has been reported as compared to a pure high-κ AlOx RRAM. The origin of the NL nature has been discussed using the hopping model and Luittenger's 1D metal theory. The nonlinearity can be further improved by structure engineering and will improve the sensing margin of the devices, which is rewarding for crossbar array integration.},

  Abstract                 = {Electrical connectivity in networks of nanoscale junctions must be better understood if nanowire devices are to be scaled up from single wires to functional material systems. We show that the natural connectivity behaviour found in random nanowire networks presents a new paradigm for creating multi-functional, programmable materials. In devices made from networks of Ni/NiO core-shell nanowires at different length scales, we discover the emergence of distinct behavioural regimes when networks are electrically stressed. We show that a small network, with few nanowire-nanowire junctions, acts as a unipolar resistive switch, demonstrating very high ON/OFF current ratios (>10(5)). However, large networks of nanowires distribute an applied bias across a large number of junctions, and thus respond not by switching but instead by evolving connectivity. We demonstrate that these emergent properties lead to fault-tolerant materials whose resistance may be tuned, and which are capable of adaptively reconfiguring under stress. By combining these two behavioural regimes, we demonstrate that the same nanowire network may be programmed to act both as a metallic interconnect, and a resistive switch device with high ON/OFF ratio. These results enable the fabrication of programmable, multi-functional materials from random nanowire networks.},

The measurement results obtained immediately after irradiation demonstrate that the proton-based total dose will introduce significant variations in the operation voltages and resistance values. These effects are enhanced almost linearly when the dose increases from 1.5 to 5 Giga-rad[Si]. Furthermore, five days after irradiation, the electrical properties of the device rebound, resulting in reduced operation voltages and resistance values. This is consistent with the time-dependent super-recovery behavior observed previously in CMOS gate oxide. These results can be explained by the proton irradiation effect on the electron/hole trap density inside HfO(2) and its impact on ReRAM device metallic filament formation-and-rupture, which is based on electrolyte theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Resistive-switching memory (RRAM) is an emerging nanoscale device based on the localized metal-insulator transition within a few-nanometer-sized metal oxide region. RRAM is one of the most promising memory technologies for the ultimate downscaling of nonvolatile memory. However, to develop memory arrays with densities approaching 1 Tb cm(-2) , bottom-up schemes based on synthesis and assembly of metal oxide nanowires (NWs) must be demonstrated. A RRAM memory device based on core-shell Ni-NiO NWs is presented, in which the Ni core plays the role of the metallic interconnect, while the NiO shell serves as the active switching layer. A resistance change of at least two orders of magnitude is shown on electrical operation of the device, and the metal-insulator switching is unequivocally demonstrated to take place in the NiO shell at the crossing between two NWs or between a NW and a gold electrode strip. Since the fabrication of the NW crossbar device is not limited by lithography, this approach may provide a basis for high-density, low-cost crossbar memory with long-term storage stability.},

In addition, brilliant mechanical and electrical stabilities of this device are demonstrated when under harsh bending (bending cycle >500, bending radius <10 mm). Finally, the underlying mechanism for resistance switching of this kind of device is discussed, and metallic conducting filament formation and annihilation related to oxidization/redox of Al and Al anions migrating in the parylene layer can be attributed to resistance switching in this device.

  Abstract                 = {In this review, we provide an overview of our work in resistive switching mechanisms on oxide-based resistance random access memory (RRAM) devices. Based on the investigation of physical and chemical mechanisms, we focus on its materials, device structures, and treatment methods so as to provide an in-depth perspective of state-of-the-art oxide-based RRAM. The critical voltage and constant reaction energy properties were found, which can be used to prospectively modulate voltage and operation time to control RRAM device working performance and forecast material composition. The quantized switching phenomena in RRAM devices were demonstrated at ultra-cryogenic temperature (4K), which is attributed to the atomic-level reaction in metallic filament. In the aspect of chemical mechanisms, we use the Coulomb Faraday theorem to investigate the chemical reaction equations of RRAM for the first time. We can clearly observe that the first-order reaction series is the basis for chemical reaction during reset process in the study. Furthermore, the activation energy of chemical reactions can be extracted by changing temperature during the reset process, from which the oxygen ion reaction process can be found in the RRAM device. As for its materials, silicon oxide is compatible to semiconductor fabrication lines. It is especially promising for the silicon oxide-doped metal technology to be introduced into the industry. Based on that, double-ended graphene oxide-doped silicon oxide based via-structure RRAM with filament self-aligning formation, and self-current limiting operation ability is demonstrated. The outstanding device characteristics are attributed to the oxidation and reduction of graphene oxide flakes formed during the sputter process. Besides, we have also adopted a new concept of supercritical CO2 fluid treatment to efficiently reduce the operation current of RRAM devices for portable electronic applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Bipolar resistive switching in Al/fuel-assisted NiO(x) (40 nm)/ITO devices is demonstrated in this work. XPS analysis reveals the simultaneous presence of metallic Ni, Ni(2)O(3), and NiO components in the fuel-assisted NiO(x). The concentration, as well as spreading of the metallic Ni and accompanying oxygen vacancies, are related to the Al/NiO(x) interfacial reaction, which is enhanced by the increasing thickness of the Al top electrode. Correspondingly, the preswitching-on voltage decreases while the preswitching-off voltage increases with increasing thickness (from 15 to 60 nm) of Al. However, in regular switching operation, set and reset voltages are considerably lowered for devices with an increased thickness of the Al top electrode. The bipolar resistive switching behaviors of Al/fuel-assisted NiO(x)/ITO devices are therefore discussed based on the formation of conductive paths and their correlation with the Al-electrode modulated composition in the fuel-assisted NiO(x). The Al/NiO(x) interfacial reaction region pairs with ITO to form a dual-oxygen-reservoir structure. Mechanisms of construction/destruction of conducting paths originating from the electrochemical redox reactions at the interface between NiO(x), and the dual oxygen reservoirs will also be explicated.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the Mott insulator compound GaTa4Se8 in which we previously discovered an electric-field-induced resistive transition. We show that the resistive switching is associated to the appearance of metallic and super-insulating nanodomains by means of scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS). Moreover, we show that local electronic transitions can be controlled at the nanoscale at room temperature using the electric field of the STM tip. This opens the way for possible applications in resistive random access memories (RRAM) devices.},

This transition occurs at a constant critical resistivity of 7 mohm-cm regardless of temperature or bias conditions and the transition time is significantly smaller than abrupt transitions by avalanche breakdown in other small gap Mott insulating materials. Furthermore, this critical resistivity corresponds to a carrier density of 4.5 × 10(19) cm(-3), which compares well with the critical carrier density for the commensurate to nearly commensurate charge density wave transition. These results suggest that the transition is facilitated by a carrier driven collapse of the Mott gap in 1T-TaS2, which results in fast (3 ns) switching.},

While the applicative interest for possible use in highly dense resistance switching memory (RRAM) is extremely high, switching phenomena pose strong fundamental challenges in understanding the physical mechanisms and models. This work addresses the set and reset mechanisms for the formation and rupture of nanofilaments in NiO RRAM devices. Reset is described in terms of thermally-accelerated diffusion and oxidation processes, and its resistance dependence is explained by size-dependent Joule heating and oxidation. The filament is described as a region with locally-enhanced doping, resulting in an insulator-metal transition driven by structural and chemical defects. The set mechanism is explained by a threshold switching effect, triggering chemical reduction and a consequent local increase of metallic doping. The possible use of the observed resistance-dependent reset and set parameters to improve the memory array operation and variability is finally discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The performances of conductive-bridging random access memory (CBRAM) have been reviewed for different switching materials such as chalcogenides, oxides, and bilayers in different structures. The structure consists of an inert electrode and one oxidized electrode of copper (Cu) or silver (Ag). The switching mechanism is the formation/dissolution of a metallic filament in the switching materials under external bias. However, the growth dynamics of the metallic filament in different switching materials are still debated. All CBRAM devices are switching under an operation current of 0.1 μA to 1 mA, and an operation voltage of ±2 V is also needed. The device can reach a low current of 5 pA; however, current compliance-dependent reliability is a challenging issue. Although a chalcogenide-based material has opportunity to have better endurance as compared to an oxide-based material, data retention and integration with the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process are also issues. Devices with bilayer switching materials show better resistive switching characteristics as compared to those with a single switching layer, especially a program/erase endurance of >10(5) cycles with a high speed of few nanoseconds. Multi-level cell operation is possible, but the stability of the high resistance state is also an important reliability concern. These devices show a good data retention of >10(5) s at >85°C. However, more study is needed to achieve a 10-year guarantee of data retention for non-volatile memory application. The crossbar memory is benefited for high density with low power operation. Some CBRAM devices as a chip have been reported for proto-typical production. This review shows that operation current should be optimized for few microamperes with a maintaining speed of few nanoseconds, which will have challenges and also opportunities for three-dimensional (3D) architecture.},

Counter-clockwise bipolar RS memory current-voltage (I-V) characteristics are observed within the RS voltage window of -2.5 to +1.9 V, with good endurance and retention properties. As the bias voltage increases further beyond 4 V under a forward bias, a forming process occurs resulting in irreversible RS mode transformation from bipolar to unipolar mode. This switching mode transformation is a direct consequence of thermally activated Ti out-diffusion from a Ti adhesion layer. Transition metal Ti effectively out-diffuses through the loose Pt electrode layer at high substrate temperatures, leading to the unintended formation of a thin titanium oxide (TiO(x) where x < 2) layer between the Pt electrode and the SZO:Cr layer as well as additional Ti atoms in the SZO:Cr layer. Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy depth-profile measurements provided apparent evidence of the Ti out-diffusion phenomenon. We propose that the out-diffusion-induced additional Ti atoms in the SZO:Cr layer contributes to the creation of the metallic filamentary channels.},

  Abstract                 = {Memristors have recently generated significant interest due to their potential use in nanoscale logic and memory devices. Of the four passive circuit elements, the memristor (a two-terminal hysteretic switch) has so far proved hard to fabricate out of a single material. Here we employ electromigration to create a reversible passive electrical switch, a memristive device, from a single-component metallic nanowire. To achieve resistive switching in a single-component structure we introduce a new class of memristors, devices in which the state variable of resistance is the system's physical geometry. By exploiting electromigration to reversibly alter the geometry, we repeatedly switch the resistance of single-component metallic nanowires between low and high states over many cycles. The reversible electromigration causes the nanowire to be cyclically narrowed to approximately 10 nm in width, resulting in a change in resistance by a factor of two. As a result, this work represents a potential route to the creation of nanoscale circuits from a single metallic element.},

To experimentally derive the switching power universality, systematic measurements of the switching voltage and current are performed, and neither of these correlate with one another. As the switching resistance (R) increases, the switching power (P) decreases following a power law P ∝ R(-β), regardless of the device configurations. The observed switching power universality is indicative of the existence of a commonly applicable switching mechanism. The origin of the power universality is discussed based on a metallic filament model and thermo-chemical reaction.},

The microstructures of the LAO/STO interface are characterized by Cs-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, which reveals the element intermixing at the interface. The inhomogeneous element distribution may result in carrier localization, which is responsible for the insulating state. The insulating state of such interface can be converted to metallic state by light illumination and the metallic state maintains after light off due to giant persistent photoconductivity (PPC) effect. The on/off ratio between the PPC and the initial dark conductance is as large as 10⁵. The metallic state also can be converted back to insulating state by applying gate voltage. Reversible and reproducible resistive switching makes LAO/STO interface promising as a nonvolatile memory. Our results deepen the understanding of PPC phenomenon in LAO/STO, and pave the way for the development of all-oxide electronics integrating information storage devices.},

  Abstract                 = {Resistance change random access memory (RRAM) cells, typically built as MIM capacitor structures, consist of insulating layers I sandwiched between metal layers M, where the insulator performs the resistance switching operation. These devices can be electrically switched between two or more stable resistance states at a speed of nanoseconds, with long retention times, high switching endurance, low read voltage, and large switching windows. They are attractive candidates for next-generation non-volatile memory, particularly as a flash successor, as the material properties can be scaled to the nanometer regime. Several resistance switching models have been suggested so far for transition metal oxide based devices, such as charge trapping, conductive filament formation, Schottky barrier modulation, and electrochemical migration of point defects. The underlying fundamental principles of the switching mechanism still lack a detailed understanding, i.e. how to control and modulate the electrical characteristics of devices incorporating defects and impurities, such as oxygen vacancies, metal interstitials, hydrogen, and other metallic atoms acting as dopants. In this paper, state of the art ab initio theoretical methods are employed to understand the effects that filamentary types of stable oxygen vacancy configurations in TiO(2) and NiO have on the electronic conduction. It is shown that strong electronic interactions between metal ions adjacent to oxygen vacancy sites results in the formation of a conductive path and thus can explain the 'ON' site conduction in these materials. Implication of hydrogen doping on electroforming is discussed for Pr(0.7)Ca(0.3)MnO(3) devices based on electrical characterization and FTIR measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {Resistive switching offers a promising route to universal electronic memory, potentially replacing current technologies that are approaching their fundamental limits. In many cases switching originates from the reversible formation and dissolution of nanometre-scale conductive filaments, which constrain the motion of electrons, leading to the quantisation of device conductance into multiples of the fundamental unit of conductance, G0. Such quantum effects appear when the constriction diameter approaches the Fermi wavelength of the electron in the medium - typically several nanometres. Here we find that the conductance of silicon-rich silica (SiOx) resistive switches is quantised in half-integer multiples of G0. In contrast to other resistive switching systems this quantisation is intrinsic to SiOx, and is not due to drift of metallic ions. Half-integer quantisation is explained in terms of the filament structure and formation mechanism, which allows us to distinguish between systems that exhibit integer and half-integer quantisation.},

To simulate the switching process, we consider several different processes on the atomic scale: electron-transfer reactions at the boundaries, ion migration, adsorption/desorption from/to interfaces, surface diffusion and nucleation. These processes result in a growth/dissolution of a metallic filament within an insulating matrix. In addition, the model includes electron tunneling between the growing filament and the counter electrode, which allows for simulating multilevel switching. It is shown that the simulation model can reproduce the reported switching kinetics, switching variability and multilevel capabilities of ECM devices. As a major result, the influence of mechanical stress working on the host matrix due to the filamentary growth is investigated. It is demonstrated that the size and shape of the filament depend on the Young's modulus of the insulating matrix. For high values a wire-like structure evolves, whereas the shape is dendritic if the Young's modulus is negligible.},

The switching between different redox states in both oxides is achieved without the need for physical electrical contact by controlling the magnitude and polarity of the applied voltage between the STM tip and the sample surface. We demonstrate for TaOx films that two switching mechanisms operate. Reduced tantalum oxide shows resistive switching due to the formation of metallic Ta, but partial oxidation of the samples changes the switching mechanism to one mediated mainly by oxygen vacancies. For SrRuO3, we found that the switching mechanism depends on the polarity of the applied voltage and involves formation, annihilation, and migration of oxygen vacancies. Although TaOx and SrRuO3 differ significantly in their electronic and structural properties, the resistive switching mechanisms could be elaborated based on STM measurements, proving the general capability of this method for studying resistive switching phenomena in different classes of transition metal oxides.},

  Abstract                 = {We report the study of gold-SrTiO3 (STO)-gold memristors where the doping concentration in STO can be fine-tuned through electric field migration of oxygen vacancies. In this tunnel junction device, the evolution of the density of states (DOS) can be followed continuously across the metal-insulator transition (MIT). At very low dopant concentration, the junction displays characteristic signatures of discrete dopant levels. As the dopant concentration increases, the semiconductor band gap fills in but a soft Coulomb gap remains. At even higher doping, a transition to a metallic state occurs where the DOS at the Fermi level becomes finite and Altshuler-Aronov corrections to the DOS are observed. At the critical point of the MIT, the DOS scales linearly with energy N(ϵ)∼ϵ, the possible signature of multifractality.},

  Abstract                 = {ZnO has intrinsic semiconductor conductivity because of an unintentional doping mechanism resulting from the growth process that is mainly attributable to oxygen vacancies (VO) positioned in the bandgap. ZnO has multiple electronic states that depend on the number of vacancies and the charge state of each vacancy. In addition to the individual electron states, the vacancies have different vibrational states. We developed a high-temperature precursor vapor mask technique using Al2O3 to pattern the atomic layer deposition of ZnO and Al:ZnO layers on ZnO-based substrates. This technique was used to create a memristor device based on Al:ZnO thin films having metallic and semiconducting and insulating transport properties ZnO. We demonstrated that adding combination of Al2O3 and TiO2 barrier layers improved the resistive switching behavior. The change in the resistance between the high- and low-resistivity states of the memristor with a combination of Al2O3 and TiO2 was approximately 157\%. The devices were exposed to laser light from three different laser diodes. The 450 nm laser diode noticeably affected the combined Al2O3 and TiO2 barrier, creating a high-resistivity state with a 2.9\% shift under illumination. The high-resistivity state shift under laser illumination indicates defect shifts and the thermodynamic transition of ZnO defects.},

  Abstract                 = {Chua [IEEE Trans. Circuit Theory 1, 507 (1971).] argued that, in addition to the standard resistors, capacitors, and inductors, there must be a fourth fundamental element in electrical circuits, which he called a memory resistor or memristor. Strukov et al. [Nature (London) 453, 80 (2008)] showed how memristive behavior arises in some thin semiconducting films. Unlike other passive elements, however, a memristor with large sizes cannot be fabricated, because scale up of a memristor to dimensions of the order of microns causes loss of the memristive effect by decreasing the width of the doped region relative to the overall size of the memristor. A microscale memristor is, however, essential to most of the potential applications. One way of fabricating such a microscale memristor without losing the memristive effect is to make a network of very small interconnected memristors. We report the results of numerical simulations of electrical currents in such networks of interconnected memristors, as well as memristors and Ohmic conductors. The memristor networks exhibit a rich variety of interesting properties, including weakly and strongly memristive regimes, a possible first-order transition at the connectivity threshold, generation of second harmonics in the strongly memristive regime, and the universal dependence of the network's strength on the frequency. Moreover, we show that the polarity of the memristors can play an important role in the overall properties of the memristor network, in particular its speed of switching, which may have a potentially important application to faster computers. None of these properties are exhibited by linear resistor networks, or even by nonlinear resistor networks without a memory effect.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce electrochemical dynamics with implicit degrees of freedom (EChemDID), a model to describe electrochemical driving force in reactive molecular dynamics simulations. The method describes the equilibration of external electrochemical potentials (voltage) within metallic structures and their effect on the self-consistent partial atomic charges used in reactive molecular dynamics. An additional variable assigned to each atom denotes the local potential in its vicinity and we use fictitious, but computationally convenient, dynamics to describe its equilibration within connected metallic structures on-the-fly during the molecular dynamics simulation. This local electrostatic potential is used to dynamically modify the atomic electronegativities used to compute partial atomic changes via charge equilibration. Validation tests show that the method provides an accurate description of the electric fields generated by the applied voltage and the driving force for electrochemical reactions. We demonstrate EChemDID via simulations of the operation of electrochemical metallization cells. The simulations predict the switching of the device between a high-resistance to a low-resistance state as a conductive metallic bridge is formed and resistive currents that can be compared with experimental measurements. In addition to applications in nanoelectronics, EChemDID could be useful to model electrochemical energy conversion devices.},

In this paper, the low energy Ar(+) irradiation induced shunting effect of forming-free, non-volatile resistive switching in polycrystalline BiFeO3 thin film capacitor-like structures with macroscopic bottom and top contacts was investigated. Oxygen atoms at the BiFeO3 surface are preferentially sputtered by Ar(+) ion irradiation and oxygen vacancies and a metallic Bi phase are formed at the surface of the BiFeO3 thin film before deposition of the top contacts. A phenomenological model is that of nanoscale shunt resistors formed in parallel to the actual BiFeO3 thin film capacitor-like structure. This model fits the noticeable increase of the retention stability and current density after irradiation. The formation of stable and conductive shunts is further evidenced by conductive atomic force microscopy measurements.},

The strategy intentionally avoids the standard capacitor-like geometry, thus allowing the study of the electronic transport properties of the locally modified region, and approaches the integration of functional oxides in low dimensional devices while providing macroscopic evidence of nanoscale resistive switching (RS). The metallic and ferromagnetic LSMO is locally modified from its low resistance state (LRS) to a high resistance state (HRS) when a bias voltage is applied on its surface through the conducting tip, which acts as a mobile electrode. Starting from a metallic oxide the electroforming process is not required, thus avoiding one of the major drawbacks for the implementation of memory devices based on RS phenomena. The application of a bias voltage generates an electric field that promotes charge depletion, leading to a strong increase of the resistance, i.e. to the HRS. This effect is not only confined to the outermost surface layer, its spatial extension and final HRS condition can be modulated by the magnitude and duration of the potential applied, opening the door to the implementation of multilevel devices. In addition, the half-metallic character, i.e. total spin polarization, of LSMO might allow the implementation of memory elements and active spintronic devices in the very same material. The stability of the HRS and LRS as a function of temperature, magnetic field and compliance current is also analyzed, allowing the characterization of the nature of the switching process and the active material.},

  Abstract                 = {Atomic switch networks (ASNs) have been shown to generate network level dynamics that resemble those observed in biological neural networks. To facilitate understanding and control of these behaviors, we developed a numerical model based on the synapse-like properties of individual atomic switches and the random nature of the network wiring. We validated the model against various experimental results highlighting the possibility to functionalize the network plasticity and the differences between an atomic switch in isolation and its behaviors in a network. The effects of changing connectivity density on the nonlinear dynamics were examined as characterized by higher harmonic generation in response to AC inputs. To demonstrate their utility for computation, we subjected the simulated network to training within the framework of reservoir computing and showed initial evidence of the ASN acting as a reservoir which may be optimized for specific tasks by adjusting the input gain. The work presented represents steps in a unified approach to experimentation and theory of complex systems to make ASNs a uniquely scalable platform for neuromorphic computing.},

However, the lack of understanding of the switching mechanism at the nanoscale level prevents successful transfer to industry. In this paper, Ag/GeSx/W CBRAM devices are analyzed using depth selective X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy before and after switching. The study of the local environment around Ag atoms in such devices reveals that Ag is in two very distinct environments with short Ag-S bonds due to Ag dissolved in the GeSx matrix, and longer Ag-Ag bonds related to an Ag metallic phase. These experiments allow the conclusion that the switching process involves the formation of metallic Ag nano-filaments initiated at the Ag electrode. All these experimental features are well supported by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations showing that Ag favorably bonds to S atoms, and permit the proposal of a model at the microscopic level that can explain the instability of the conductive state in these Ag-GeSx CBRAM devices. Finally, the principle of the nondestructive method described here can be extended to other types of resistive memory concepts.},

In these experimental embodiments,complex networks of coupled atomic switches exhibit emergent criticality similar in nature to previously reported electrical activity of biological brains and neuron assemblies. Rapid fluctuations in electrical conductance display metastability and power law scaling of temporal correlation lengths that are attributed to dynamic reorganization of the interconnected electro-ionic network resulting from induced non-equilibrium thermodynamic instabilities. These collective properties indicate a potential utility for realtime,multi-input processing of distributed sensory data through reservoir computation.

  Abstract                 = {Resistive switching memories (ReRAMs) are the major candidates for replacing the state-of-the-art memory technology in future nanoelectronics. These nonvolatile memory cells are based on nanoionic redox processes and offer prospects for high scalability, ultrafast write and read access, and low power consumption. The interfacial electrochemical reactions of oxidation and reduction of ions necessarily needed for resistive switching result inevitably in nonequilibrium states, which play a fundamental role in the processes involved during device operation. We report on nonequilibrium states in SiO2-based ReRAMs being induced during the resistance transition. It is demonstrated that the formation of metallic cations proceeds in parallel to reduction of moisture, supplied by the ambient. The latter results in the formation of an electromotive force in the range of up to 600 mV. The outcome of the study highlights the hitherto overlooked necessity of a counter charge/reaction to keep the charge electroneutrality in cation-transporting thin films, making it hard to analyze and compare experimental results under different ambient conditions such as water partial pressure. Together with the dependence of the electromotive force on the ambient, these results contribute to the microscopic understanding of the resistive switching phenomena in cation-based ReRAMs.},

Both metallic and semiconducting CNTs effectively switch AlOx bits between memory states with high and low resistance. The low-resistance state scales linearly with CNT series resistance down to ∼10 MΩ, at which point the ON-state resistance of the AlOx filament becomes the limiting factor. Dependence of switching behavior on the number of cross-points suggests a single channel to dominate the overall characteristics in multi-crossbar devices. We demonstrate ON/OFF ratios up to 5 × 10(5) and programming currents of 1 to 100 nA with few-volt set/reset voltages. Remarkably low reset currents enable a switching power of 10-100 nW and estimated switching energy as low as 0.1-10 fJ per bit. These results are essential for understanding the ultimate scaling limits of resistive random access memory at single-nanometer bit dimensions.},

The ion-migration effects are coupled to redox processes which cause the change in resistance. They are subdivided into cation-migration cells, based on the electrochemical growth and dissolution of metallic filaments, and anion-migration cells, typically realized with transition metal oxides as the insulator, in which electronically conducting paths of sub-oxides are formed and removed by local redox processes.

Based on distinct fundamental switching mechanisms, two types of ReRAM have emerged: electrochemical metallization memories, in which the mobile species is thought to be metal cations, and valence change memories, in which the mobile species is thought to be oxygen anions (or positively charged oxygen vacancies). Here we show, using scanning tunnelling microscopy and supported by potentiodynamic current-voltage measurements, that in three typical valence change memory materials (TaO(x), HfO(x) and TiO(x)) the host metal cations are mobile in films of 2 nm thickness. The cations can form metallic filaments and participate in the resistive switching process, illustrating that there is a bridge between the electrochemical metallization mechanism and the valence change mechanism. Reset/Set operations are, we suggest, driven by oxidation (passivation) and reduction reactions. For the Ta/Ta2O5 system, a rutile-type TaO2 film is believed to mediate switching, and we show that devices can be switched from a valence change mode to an electrochemical metallization mode by introducing an intermediate layer of amorphous carbon.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work, a tungsten oxide (WO(x)) film is prepared using a thiourea-assisted solution process. We demonstrate a device composed of fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)-glass/WO(x)/electrolyte/indium-tin oxide (ITO)-glass stacking electrochromic (EC) structure and Al electrodes that are locally patterned and interposed between the WO(x) film and electrolyte, which form an Al(top electrode)/WO(x)/FTO(bottom electrode) resistance random access memory (RRAM) unit. According to transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, the WO(x) film contains nanosize pores and metallic-tungsten nanoclusters which are scattered within the tungsten oxide layer and concentrated along the interface between the Al electrode and WO(x) film. With application of voltage to the ITO electrode, multiple transmittance states are achieved for the EC unit due to the different quantity of intercalated Li ions in the WO(x) film. As for the Al/WO(x)/FTO RRAM unit, a bipolar nonvolatile resistive switching behavior is attained by applying voltage on the Al top electrode, showing electrical bistability with an ON/OFF current ratio up to 1 × 10(4).},

  Abstract                 = {Resistive switching devices with a Nb2O5/NbOx bilayer stack combine threshold and memory switching. Here we present a new fabrication method to form such devices. Amorphous Nb2O5 layers were treated by a krypton irradiation. Two effects are found to turn the oxide partly into a metallic NbOx layer: preferential sputtering and interface mixing. Both effects take place at different locations in the material stack of the device; preferential sputtering affects the surface, while interface mixing appears at the bottom electrode. To separate both effects, devices were irradiated at different energies (4, 10, and 35 keV). Structural changes caused by ion irradiation are studied in detail. After successful electroforming, the devices exhibit the desired threshold switching. In addition, the choice of the current compliance defines whether a memory effect adds to the device. Findings from electrical characterization disclose a model of the layer modification during irradiation.},

In this device, the critical external compliance current is no longer necessary due to the high self-resistance of LSMO. The LMSO bottom electrode can act as a series resistor to offer a compliance current during the set process. Besides, the device also has excellent switching features which are originated in the formation of Cu filaments under external voltage. Therefore it provides the possibility of reducing power consumption and accelerating the commercialization of resistive switching devices.},

  Abstract                 = {Nanoscale metal inclusions in or on solid-state dielectrics are an integral part of modern electrocatalysis, optoelectronics, capacitors, metamaterials and memory devices. The properties of these composite systems strongly depend on the size, dispersion of the inclusions and their chemical stability, and are usually considered constant. Here we demonstrate that nanoscale inclusions (for example, clusters) in dielectrics dynamically change their shape, size and position upon applied electric field. Through systematic in situ transmission electron microscopy studies, we show that fundamental electrochemical processes can lead to universally observed nucleation and growth of metal clusters, even for inert metals like platinum. The clusters exhibit diverse dynamic behaviours governed by kinetic factors including ion mobility and redox rates, leading to different filament growth modes and structures in memristive devices. These findings reveal the microscopic origin behind resistive switching, and also provide general guidance for the design of novel devices involving electronics and ionics.},

  Abstract                 = {The nature of the conducting filaments in many resistive switching systems has been elusive. Through in situ transmission electron microscopy, we image the real-time formation and evolution of the filament in a silicon oxide resistive switch. The electroforming process is revealed to involve the local enrichment of silicon from the silicon oxide matrix. Semi-metallic silicon nanocrystals with structural variations from the conventional diamond cubic form of silicon are observed, which likely accounts for the conduction in the filament. The growth and shrinkage of the silicon nanocrystals in response to different electrical stimuli show energetically viable transition processes in the silicon forms, offering evidence for the switching mechanism. The study here also provides insights into the electrical breakdown process in silicon oxide layers, which are ubiquitous in a host of electronic devices.},

  Abstract                 = {Resistive random access memory (ReRAM) is a promising candidate for future nonvolatile memories. Resistive switching in a metal-insulator-metal structure is generally assumed to be caused by the formation/rupture of nanoscale conductive filaments (CFs) under an applied electric field. The critical issue of ReRAM for practical memory applications, however, is insufficient repeatability of the operating voltage and resistance ratio. Here, we present an innovative approach to reliably and reproducibly control the CF growth in unipolar NiO resistive memory by exploiting uniform formation of insulating SiOx nanostructures from the self-assembly of a Si-containing block copolymer. In this way, the standard deviation (SD) of set and reset voltages was markedly reduced by 76.9\% and 59.4\%, respectively. The SD of high resistance state also decreased significantly, from 6.3 × 10(7) Ω to 5.4 × 10(4) Ω. Moreover, we report direct observations of localized metallic Ni CF formation and their controllable growth using electron microscopy and discuss electrothermal simulation results based on the finite element method supporting our analysis results.},

  Abstract                 = {Reversible resistive switching between high-resistance and low-resistance states in metal-oxide-metal heterostructures makes them very interesting for applications in random access memories. While recent experimental work has shown that inserting a metallic "oxygen scavenger layer" between the positive electrode and oxide improves device performance, the fundamental understanding of how the scavenger layer modifies the heterostructure properties is lacking. We use density functional theory to calculate thermodynamic properties and conductance of TiN/HfO2/TiN heterostructures with and without a Ta scavenger layer. First, we show that Ta insertion lowers the formation energy of low-resistance states. Second, while the Ta scavenger layer reduces the Schottky barrier height in the high-resistance state by modifying the interface charge at the oxide-electrode interface, the heterostructure maintains a high resistance ratio between high- and low-resistance states. Finally, we show that the low-bias conductance of device on-states becomes much less sensitive to the spatial distribution of oxygen removed from the HfO2 in the presence of the Ta layer. By providing a fundamental understanding of the observed improvements with scavenger layers, we open a path to engineer interfaces with oxygen scavenger layers to control and enhance device performance. In turn, this may enable the realization of a non-volatile low-power memory technology with concomitant reduction in energy consumption by consumer electronics and offering significant benefits to society.},
