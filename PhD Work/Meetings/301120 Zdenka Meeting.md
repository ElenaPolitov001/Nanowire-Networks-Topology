**Weighted mean of each pixel for MC and NLT**

- For each pixel, find the 'bin' corresponding to its performance/color and weight it based on the number of pixels that have that 'bin'/color --> Weighted Normalization + Mean

**Variability in Performance** - are random networks more random/variable in performance compared to ours?

- compare networks with similar avg degree



**Edge of chaos** - frequency vs amplitude - where are the networks sitting?

- ask Joel for help

  

**Start building skeleton of results section:**

Density+Modularity in NWNS:

- headings/subheadings/images/etc.

NWNS vs other networks:

- headings/subheadings/images/etc.





**optional:**

Case Studies for a particular density:

- No Current path formed high NLT vs low NLT
- Lots of Current Paths formed vs Not many current paths formed
