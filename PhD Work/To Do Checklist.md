To Do - 01/10/2020:

~~Double check colorbars in 2D Histrograms:~~

- ~~Compare NWN with Hierarchical at high modularity & for same small worldness~~

- ~~Control at low, medium high densities (best perfoming networks?)~~

- ~~How do we get higher average degrees for our networks?~~

- ~~Density Colorbar for Smallworldness  - NWN~~
  
  - Path length and clustering how do they change?
  
- ~~Functional Connectivity~~

  

Do networks with more junctions (more computing resources) do better regardless of number of nodes?

- Compare networks with same number of junctions, but different number of nodes

  

**PLOT SUBGRAPHS + CURRENT OVERLAY** 

	- at what density does the current path form for each voltage? 
	- at what density does current flow too much?

**IS CURRENT PATH FORMED AT A CERTAIN VOLTAGE FOR EACH DENSITY?** 



**--- Case study for network with different NLT (min vs max)**
