# Curve Fitting

Here I look at different network characteristic distributions (e.g. Degree, PCoeff, MZ and Betweenness Centrality) and perform curve fitting to categorise the networks. The hypothesis is that networks of varying performance on a Nonlinear Transformation task (i.e. accuracy) will fit into distinct categories, or groups of distinct categories.
