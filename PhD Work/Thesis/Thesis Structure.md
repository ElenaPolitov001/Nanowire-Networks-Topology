Structural Connectivity

Functionality

- Compare Different Networks
- Change Density of NWNs
- Change Modularity of NWNs
  - Without controlling for density vs Controlling for density (rewired)
  - Network Multi-Tasking (NLT + MC) in different modules
    - For each Voltage/Modularity Pair, *p*, find the max and do Max-p / Max
      - Then Normalize this, and do NormNLT + NormMC / 2 (average)
    - Sample from whole network vs Sample from each module individually
- Change Small Worldness Using WS (SUPPLEMENTARY)
- COMPARE NWN REWIRED + NWN WITH MULTITASKING
