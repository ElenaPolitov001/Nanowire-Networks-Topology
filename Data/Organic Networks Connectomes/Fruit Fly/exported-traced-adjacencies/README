Hemibrain Adjacency Table
=========================

This directory contains the exported adjacency table for all
non-cropped Traced Neurons in the hemibrain dataset from
https://neuprint.janelia.org.


Errata and Changes
------------------
2020-01-28:
    A previous version of these files listed 'None' as an ROI,
    but its meaning was not documented accurately in this README.
    In this version, 'None' has been removed from the table.

    A previous version of these files contained the following errors:
    - The roi-connections file contained non-primary ROIs in
      addition to primary ROIs
    - The 'total-connections' file had incorrect counts
      (some connections were double-counted)
    

traced-neurons.csv
------------------
Contains a table of the neuron IDs, types, and instance names.


traced-total-connections.csv
----------------------
Contains the neuron-neuron connection table, where 'weight' corresponds
to the total synapse count in the connections between each neuron pair.


traced-roi-connections.csv
--------------------------
Contains the neuron-neuron connection table, but each connection pair
is split across multiple rows, according to the ROI (brain region) in
which those synapses reside.  Only "primary" ROIs are referenced.
If a connection includes synapses which do not reside in any primary
ROI, those synapses are not represented in the table.
You can infer the count of missing synapses by subtracting the summed
per-ROI weights from the counts 'total' connections table (described above).


Provenance
----------
These results were obtained via the neuprint-python[1] library (v0.3) as follows:

>>> from neuprint import Client, fetch_traced_adjacencies
>>> client = Client('neuprint.janelia.org', 'hemibrain:v1.0', token=...)
>>> traced_df, roi_conn_df = fetch_traced_adjacencies('exported-connections')
