Supervisors: Zdenka Kuncic & Mac Shine | Collaborators: Mike Li, Adrian Diaz Alvarez, Joel Hochstetter, Ruomin Zhu, Natesh Ganesh, Tomonobu Nakayama


## Contents of this Repository:
This repository houses the main code to run, save, load and analyse the computational model of self-assembled silver nanowire networks (AgNWs),
created by Zdenka Kuncic in collaboration with Tomonobu Nakayama and Adrian Diaz Alvarez of the MANA institute in Japan.


The code is split into a number of sections:

**Analysis** - This houses PhD code written by Alon Loeffler. The nanowire network model (edamame) used is created by [Ruomin Zhu](https://github.com/rzhu40)  Within this folder, there are a number of analyses that can be conducted:
  - **LDA Analysis**
  - [PAPER 1 - Topological Properties of Nanowire Networks](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00184/full?report=reader)
    - **Graph Theory Analysis**
    - **Network Exploration**
  - [PAPER 2 - Modularity and Multitasking in Neuro-memristive Nanowire Networks](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4386/ac156f/meta)
    - **Nonlinear Transformation + Memory Capacity Tasks** - path: /Analysis/Functional Connectivity/Functional Tasks/NWN/
    - **Multitasking + Modularity** - path: /Analysis/Functional Connectivity/Functional Tasks/NWN/
  - [PAPER 3 - Tuning pathways in Nanowire networks using only external feedback]
    - **Associative Learning + Equilibrium Propagation** - path: /Analysis/Training/EquilProp/
    
**Data** - This folder houses the data saved from Adrian and Zdenka's models, as well as any figures or analysis data from the Analysis folder. This folder is not included in the repository, as it is much too large for GitHub. To access any of the Data, please email Alon Loeffler at aloe8475@uni.sydney.edu.au to request an upload to our shared Dropbox.
